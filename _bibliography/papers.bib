abstract = {A graph contains plentiful structures. Some minority structures are important, such as high degree nodes and bridges. Detecting these minority structures is beneficial to accelerate computational graph analysis and improve the comprehension of graph visualization. Regarding four typical minority structures, this paper proposes two algorithms to detect these structures fast and efficiently. A set of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},
