    - title: Generate Object-specific Image with Diffusion Model and RLPrompt
      advisor: Prof. Zhiting Hu, Assistant Professor at UCSD
      institution: University of California, San Diego, California, USA
      year: 2022 - Present
      description:
        - Independent research advised by Prof. Zhiting Hu, Assistant Professor at UCSD
        - Text-to-image generating model like Diffusion model has the ability to generate abundant different images with different objects in the training data. However, it doesn’t have the ability to generate new images using a specific object/person/subject in a given image. This project aims to address this challenge by using a Reinforcement Learning method (RLPrompt) to search for the best hard prompt as an text identifier of the subject in several images. This identifier could be embedded in prompts or combined with other identifiers, thereby increasing flexibility and controllability during image generation.
        - This project is still on-going advised by Prof. Zhiting.

      advisor: Research Assistant to Professor Ying Zhao, Sub-Dean of the Department of Computer Science and Technology
      institution: Central South University, Hunan, China
      year: Dec. 2020 – Jul. 2021
      description:
        - This project aimed to improve the interpretability of CNN by visualization and provide guidance for feature transferring of high-value features in CNN
        - Proposed a method called Average Image Analysis to discuss the low-frequency information learned in the network, which quantifies the influence of the input on the neurons by calculating the cosine distance of guided-backpropagation neural visualization results and average image of data sets.
        - This method quantifies gradient-based CNN visualization methods, provides more understanding of high semantic information in different depths in the network, and could give guidance to feature transfer in the subsequent step.

      advisor: Prof. Ying Zhao, Sub-Dean of the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Central South University
      institution: Central South University, Hunan, China
      year: Jan. 2021 – Jun. 2021
      description: 
        - In line with solving practical medical problems, I assisted with researching medical triage issues in China and with my classmates, built an automatic medical triage system based on medical question answering data using Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers
        - Our system performs well when testing with 95% top-2 accuracy on 5 major disease data sets and 78.3% top-2 accuracy on 20 disease data sets, which is significantly higher than Sequence-to-Sequence models built by others

    - title: Detecting Malicious Webshells by Constructing Webshell Family Clusters
      advisor: Prof. Ying Zhao, Sub-Dean of the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Central South University
      institution: Central South University, Hunan, China
      year: Dec. 2021 - May 2022
      description:
        - Webshells are malicious scripts in web servers. This project aims to detect malicious webshells by constructing webshell families according to the clusters of their program call sequences. The main method is composed of  reducing the dimensionality of webshell code with Auto-encoders, clustering low-dimensional webshells and interactively constructing webshell families using Visualization techniques.
        - I researched on text classification CNN, implemented and tested different CNN-based Auto-encoders and applied different clustering algorithms. I also merged dimensionality reduction and clustering into one model using Contrastive Dimensionality Reduction model.

    - title: Visualization of minority structures in graphs
      advisor: Prof. Fangfang Zhou, Professor at Central South University
      institution: Central South University, Hunan, China
      year: Nov. 2019 – Apr. 2020
      description:
        - Minority structures in a graph, like high degree nodes and bridges, are important for graph analysis and comprehension.
        - I proposed two kinds of minority graph structures called super pivot and huge star and one algorithm to detect these structures by identifying triangle structures using depth-first-search. Experiments showed that this algorithm worked well on small- and middle-scale graphs with high accuracy, recall value and time efficiency.
        - VINCI 2020 poster, “A fast method for detecting minority structures in a graph.”. In the proposal, We proposed four typical minority structures in graphs and two algorithms to detect these structures fast and efficiently.
