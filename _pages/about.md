I am now an MSCS student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD), expected to graduate in Jun. 2024. And I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in the future. I am luckily to be mentored by professors at UCSD in both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, and have hands-on experiences in both fields. I am now mentored by Prof. [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and Postdoc. [Zhen Wang](https://zhenwang9102.github.io/) in Large Language Model (LLM) Reasoning, Agent, and Prompting. I am also mentored by Prof. [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) in generative models (diffusion model). Before UCSD, I graduated from Central South University (CSU) in Hunan, China, mentored by Prof. [Ying Zhao](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/zhaoying). 

Research Interests
------
- **Large Language Models (LLMs) with World Models**: Augmenting LLMs with a world model formulation to enable principled decision-making, planning, and simulation. Enhancing the LLM's abilities in reasoning, planning, and interacting with the world. ([LLM Reasoners](https://www.llm-reasoners.net/))
- **Foundation Model Prompting**: Employing interpretable prompting to bridge the domain gap between user objectives and the outputs of foundation models. Effectively boosting the performance of foundation models on complex tasks through efficient and effective prompting. ([PromptAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16427))
- **Semantic Enhancement and Control of Generative Models**: Generative models, such as text-to-image models, sometimes exhibit semantic inconsistencies and challenges in control. My aim is to integrate semantic information into the models during training or inference to enhance their semantic fidelity, reliability, and controllability.

Research Overview
------
My research interests are LLM Augmentation (Prompting, Reasoning), LLM Agent, Unsupervised Learning (Generative Models), and Multi-modal Models. In Prof. Zhiting Hu's group, I worked on automatic LLM prompt optimization with Zhen. And recently we have a preprint paper, [PromptAgent: Strategic Planning with Language Models Enables Expert-level Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16427), under review of ICLR 2024 now. I am also working on LLM Reasoning by contributing to the [LLM Reasoners](https://www.llm-reasoners.net/) library, which ensembles the most recent LLM reasoning methods and models. In Prof. Zhuowen Tu's group, we are working on how to inprove diffusion models' conceptual performance with an end-to-end loss. During my undergraduate years, I was mentored by Prof. Ying Zhao and worked on Interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks and Visualization. Here is my graduate thesis: [The Research on The Interpretability Method of DeepNeural Network Based on Average Image](assets\pdf\graduate_thesis.pdf)
