I am a first-year MSCS student at UCSD, having graduated from Central South University in Hunan, China. My intention is to pursue a Ph.D. in the future, and my interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, particularly in the utilization of multimodal data. I have prior experience in both CV and NLP, having undertaken projects analyzing the interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks and medical text classification using the BERT model during my undergraduate studies. Currently, I am conducting independent research on the topic of generating object-specific images with the Diffusion Model and RLPrompt, in collaboration with Prof. Zhiting Hu (http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/).
