Hi! I am now a second-year MSCS student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD), expected to graduate in Jun. 2024. And I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in the future. I am luckily to be mentored by professors at UCSD in both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, and have hands-on experiences in both fields. I am now mentored by Prof. [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and Postdoc. [Zhen Wang](https://zhenwang9102.github.io/) in Large Language Model (LLM) Reasoning, Agent, and Prompting. I am also mentored by Prof. [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) in generative models (diffusion model). Before UCSD, I graduated from Central South University (CSU) in Hunan, China, mentored by Prof. [Ying Zhao](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/zhaoying). 

Research Overview
------
My research interests are LLM Augmentation (Prompting, Reasoning), LLM Agent, Unsupervised Learning (Generative Models), and Multi-modal Models. In Prof. Zhiting Hu's group, I worked on automatic LLM prompt optimization with Zhen. And recently we have a publication, [PromptAgent: Strategic Planning with Language Models Enables Expert-level Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16427), under review of ICLR 2024 now. I am also working on LLM Reasoning by contributing to the [LLM Reasoner](https://www.llm-reasoners.net/) library, which ensembles the most recent LLM reasoning methods and models. In Prof. Zhuowen Tu's group, we are working on how to inprove diffusion models' conceptual performance with an end-to-end loss.
